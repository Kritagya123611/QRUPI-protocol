# QRUPI – Quantum-Resistant Universal Privacy Infrastructure

QRUPI is a next-generation blockchain architecture that unifies **quantum-resistant cryptography**, **universal privacy**, and **cross-chain interoperability**.

> “Privacy, security, and post-quantum resilience — built into the very fabric of the blockchain.”

---

##  Vision

QRUPI is designed to solve three fundamental and converging problems:
-  **Privacy across chains**
-  **Interoperability at scale**
-  **Quantum resistance for the future**

Our architecture integrates:
-  Lattice-based cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium)
-  Homomorphic multi-chain state management
-  Adaptive ML-driven consensus
-  Hybrid FHE + zk-STARK proof systems
